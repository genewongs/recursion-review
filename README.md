# recursion-review
I was tasked to implement from scratch the getElementsById native method in Javascript. 
I was also tasked to implement JSON.Stringify from scratch. 

I learned a lot about recursion. I was encouraged through this project to really whiteboard and visualize what is going on behind the Javascript interpreter as I recurse over and over through functions. 
I also learned the importance of choosing let vs var in for loop scopes (especially in the context of recursion).

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
